# Internship Task 1: Flyer Design for EmpowerX Business Conference
### Iâ€™m excited to share my first design task during my internship! ðŸŽ‰

This flyer is created for the "EmpowerX Business Conference" using Adobe Illustrator. The event focuses on business growth, marketing strategies, and professional networking. I focused on balancing vibrant colors with a clean, professional layout, making sure to highlight the key information clearly.

## Key features:

### Bold Typography for headline and event details

### Color Scheme: A blend of purple and orange to maintain a professional yet energetic vibe

### Speaker Highlights: Circular frames to create a focal point for the speakers
